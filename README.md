# SEE: https://klesiu.github.io/Battleship/dist/
## Description:
This project is a classic ship game. It was created in VanillaJS with CSS and JEST support. To start the game, just enter your nickname and click the start button. Then two boards will be displayed, on one of them we must place our ships by entering the appropriate coordinates and ship position. Once the ships are ready, the script will generate an AI board. Then we can start the classic battle! When the game is over, we will be informed about the result.
